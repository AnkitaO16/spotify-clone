# Deployment Services Like:
Frontend (React):

Vercel

Netlify

Backend (Express):

Render

Railway

Fly.io

Or even Heroku (if you're into retro vibes 😄)

# 🧠 How They Handle It in a Monorepo:
Frontend (Vercel/Netlify):
You connect your monorepo to Vercel

Set the root directory to client/

Set the build command: npm run build

Set the output directory: build

Backend (Render/Railway):
Connect your repo to Render

Set the root directory to server/

Set start command: node server.js or npm start

Define environment variables (like DB URL, JWT_SECRET)

🛑 Each platform builds/deploys only the part of the repo you specify. So yes—totally works.


🎯 Next Step: Build Playlists and Songs
Let’s move toward these APIs:

🎶 POST /api/playlists – create a playlist

🎵 POST /api/songs – upload or add a song

📂 GET /api/playlists – get user playlists

📃 GET /api/playlists/:id/songs – get songs in a playlist

But first—we need to design the tables.

🧠 PostgreSQL Table Design
🗂️ playlists Table
Column	Type	Note
id	UUID (PK)	Auto-generated
user_id	UUID (FK)	Owner from users table
title	VARCHAR	Playlist name
created_at	TIMESTAMPTZ	Default: now()
🎧 songs Table
Column	Type	Note
id	UUID (PK)	Auto-generated
playlist_id	UUID (FK)	Playlist this belongs to
title	VARCHAR	Song title
artist	VARCHAR	Optional
audio_url	TEXT	URL to audio file (local/S3)
created_at	TIMESTAMPTZ	Default: now()s


Once this works, we can:

🎧 Set up local or cloud audio file streaming

🖼️ Add album art (optional)

🌐 Connect to your frontend!

🛠️ Optional Next:
Add album artwork upload

Build React frontend to play songs

Move upload to AWS S3 when ready



🔐 Next Steps
Now let’s build it page-by-page:

🌐 Web App → React + Tailwind CSS

📱 Mobile App → React Native (Expo recommended)

We’ll start with the web app first since it’ll also help us test the backend in the browser.

🌐 Web App Setup – React + Tailwind
📁 Project Structure
We'll create a simple folder like this:

cpp
Copy
Edit
spotify-clone/
├── backend/      ✅ (you already made this)
└── frontend/     🌐 (new - React app)


🔐 Auth Pages

Login

Register

🏠 Home/Dashboard

List of user playlists

📂 Playlist Page

Songs inside a playlist

Audio player

➕ Create Playlist

🎵 Upload Song

🌗 Dark Mode + Spotify UI Feel

🧩 Stack Overview
🖥 Web App:
React (with Vite for speed)

Tailwind CSS (for clean UI)

JWT Auth (stored in localStorage)

Axios (for API calls)

React Router (for navigation)

(Optional) Zustand or Redux for state

📱 Mobile App:
React Native (Expo)

JWT Auth

Axios or Fetch

Audio streaming support

Native file/audio player

Reuse backend APIs!
