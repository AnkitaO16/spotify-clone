# Deployment Services Like:
Frontend (React):

Vercel

Netlify

Backend (Express):

Render

Railway

Fly.io

Or even Heroku (if you're into retro vibes 😄)

# 🧠 How They Handle It in a Monorepo:
Frontend (Vercel/Netlify):
You connect your monorepo to Vercel

Set the root directory to client/

Set the build command: npm run build

Set the output directory: build

Backend (Render/Railway):
Connect your repo to Render

Set the root directory to server/

Set start command: node server.js or npm start

Define environment variables (like DB URL, JWT_SECRET)

🛑 Each platform builds/deploys only the part of the repo you specify. So yes—totally works.
